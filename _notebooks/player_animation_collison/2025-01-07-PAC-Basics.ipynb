    "# Game Development Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In game development, three core components often involved in creating interactive experiences are **Player**, **Animation**, and **Collision**. Understanding these components is crucial to building a functional game. Let's break them down:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Player\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Player** is typically the entity that the user controls within the game. It can represent a character, vehicle, or object, and the player's actions often define the core gameplay. Key aspects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movement**: The player can be moved using input controls like keyboard, mouse, or game controllers.\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Players often have specific attributes like health, speed, or strength.\n",
    "- **Interaction**: The player interacts with the game world by collecting items, fighting enemies, or completing objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Player:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, speed: float = 5.0):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Initialize the player at position (x, y) with a default movement speed.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        x (float): The player's starting x-coordinate.\n",
    "        y (float): The player's starting y-coordinate.\n",
    "        speed (float): The player's movement speed. Defaults to 5.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "        self.speed = speed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self, dx: float, dy: float):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Move the player based on input direction (dx, dy) and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        dx (float): The change in the x-direction.\n",
    "        dy (float): The change in the y-direction.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.x += dx * self.speed\n",
    "        self.y += dy * self.speed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_position(self) -> tuple:\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Get the current position of the player as a tuple (x, y).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Returns:\n",
    "        tuple: The player's current position.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        return self.x, self.y\n"

    "## 2. Animation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Animation** is what brings the game world to life by providing movement or visual changes to the gameâ€™s elements. This involves changing the appearance or position of sprites over time to simulate movement or transitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in animation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frames**: Animation is typically composed of individual images called frames. When shown in sequence, they create the illusion of motion.\n",
    "- **Frame Rate**: The speed at which frames are displayed, usually measured in frames per second (FPS). A higher FPS makes animations smoother.\n",
    "- **Sprites**: These are 2D images or 3D models that are animated within the game.\n",
    "- **Tweening**: Short for \"in-betweening\", this is the process of generating intermediate frames between two keyframes, providing a smooth transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animation:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, frames, frame_rate):\n",
    "        self.frames = frames\n",
    "        self.frame_rate = frame_rate\n",
    "        self.current_frame = 0\n",
    "        self.elapsed_time = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def update(self, delta_time):\n",
    "        self.elapsed_time += delta_time\n",
    "        if self.elapsed_time > 1 / self.frame_rate:\n",
    "            self.current_frame = (self.current_frame + 1) % len(self.frames)\n",
    "            self.elapsed_time = 0\n"

    "## 3. Collision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collision** detection is crucial in games to determine when objects or characters interact with each other. It allows the game to respond to events like a player hitting an obstacle, picking up an item, or attacking an enemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in collision include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bounding Box**: The simplest method of collision detection, where each object is enclosed in a rectangular or circular boundary. If these boundaries overlap, a collision is detected.\n",
    "- **Pixel-Perfect Collision**: A more precise method of detection where the individual pixels of two objects are compared. This ensures more accurate detection but is computationally more expensive.\n",
    "- **Collision Response**: Once a collision is detected, the game must decide how to respond, whether stopping movement, bouncing off surfaces, triggering damage, or generating game events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Collision:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def check_collision(rect1, rect2):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Check for a collision between two rectangular objects.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        rect1: The first rectangle with attributes x, y, width, and height.\n",
    "        rect2: The second rectangle with attributes x, y, width, and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Returns:\n",
    "        bool: True if the rectangles are colliding, False otherwise.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.width and\n",
    "            rect1.x + rect1.width > rect2.x and\n",
    "            rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.height and\n",
    "            rect1.y + rect1.height > rect2.y\n",
    "        )\n"
