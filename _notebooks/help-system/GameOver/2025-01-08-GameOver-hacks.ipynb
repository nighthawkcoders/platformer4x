    " * Coding Style Notes:\n",
    " * - GameControl is defined as an object literal\n",
    " * - GameControl is a singleton object, without a constructor.\n",
    " * - This coding style ensures one instance, thus the term object literal.\n",
    " * - Informerly, GameControl looks like defining a variable with methods contained inside.\n",
    " * - The object literal style is a common pattern in JavaScript.\n",
    " * - Observe, definition style of methods with GameControl.methodName = function() { ... }\n",
    " *   - Example: transitionToLevel(newLevel) { ... } versus transitionToLevel: function(newLevel) { ... }\n",
    " *   - Methods are defined as ES6 shorthand, versus the traditional function() style.\n",
    " *   - The shorthand style is a common pattern in JavaScript, more concise, and readable as it common to other coding languages.\n",
    " *   - But, it does not look like key-value pairs, which is the traditional object literal style.\n",
    " *   - This shorthand is part of ES6, and is supported by all modern browsers. references: https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6, https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp\n",
    " * - Observe, scoping/encapulation of this.inTransition and sharing data between methods.\n",
    " *   - this.inTransition is defined in the object literal scope.\n",
    " *   - this.inTransition is shared between methods.\n",
    " *   - this.inTransition is not accessible outside of the object literal scope.\n",
    " *   - this.inTransition is not a global or static variable.\n",

    "Sort the array by a specific metric (e.g., score or time).\n",
    "Dynamically render the leaderboard as an HTML table or list.\n",
    "Key Points\n",
    "The leaderboard is stored locally using localStorage, making it accessible only on the same device.\n",
    "The leaderboard data includes essential fields like userID, time, score, difficulty, and gameSpeed, which can be used to create comprehensive rankings.\n",
    "To implement a fully functional leaderboard, you'd need to add a UI component that fetches and displays this data, potentially sorting it by score or time."
